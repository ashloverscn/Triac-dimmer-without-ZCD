# Triac-dimmer-without-ZCD

This is a triac dimmer and here I've build my own opto coupler with LDR and LED, you dont need a ZCD to control the brightness of the lamp. 

Components required for the project- 

1. BT-136 Triac 
2. DB3 Diac 
3. LED 
4. LDR 
5. 0.1uF capacitor 
6. 220 Ohm Resistance 
7. Jumper wires 
8. Bread board. 


we will be making our own opto coupler with LED and LDR.
